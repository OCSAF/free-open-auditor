# free-open-auditor (BETA)

Free and open cyber-security auditing tool with collective intelligence.
This tool is part of the Open Cyber Security Analysis Framework.

The free-open-auditor tool runs on KALI LINUX™ and requires the following packages:

- apt-get install geoip-bin -y
- apt-get install jq -y
- easy_install shodan

**This project is still in beta stage. Ideas and adaptations are therefore very welcome.**
